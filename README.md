videosnap
=========

An open source audio/video recording component focused on recording short-form video segments.

TODO
=========
* videoplayer refactor: include videoview, scrubber, record-again button
* recording quality sucks (need to add the right knobs & dials to mediastream)
* recording progress
* max_time
* rtmpstatus: this is way too loud, need rollover, maybe tooltip
* get this deployed somewhere so people can play with it
* controls as a translucent overlay
* css colors?
* rtmpconnection: should be able to use one that is already there
* surface stream so external UI can hook up to stream events?
* can we use the OpenLaszlo doc generator to create component docs for a stand-alone library?  (or maybe would be simple enough to create a little ruby script to parse the doc comments)
* add license file to github

testing
=========
* would be good to have an interactive test file that lets you pi=oke at all of the attributes
* should be able to set an onallowed handler referencing the cam/mic to hook up UI outside of the component
